**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

Recently the Phala team released the Lens Api Oracle.  
https://medium.com/phala-network/lensapi-oracle-supercharge-your-web3-social-app-a413c936df2b

This oracle is built on offchain rollup request-response for EVM smart contracts.  
https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-bricks/tree/master/phat/contracts/action_offchain_rollup

Our team has applied to the Phala builder program to develop the offchain rollup request-response for Ink! smart contracts.

When this milestone is completed, we would like to use this offchain rollup request-response model to build:
- VRF Oracle. It should generate cryptographically secure random numbers for Ink! smart contracts
- Graph API Oracle that:
    - accesses SubQuery/SubSquid via an URI
    - transform and format the response via the JS engine developed by the Phala team
    - send the output to the Ink! smart contract

In the milestone 2, concerning the Graph Api Oracle, we provide:
- the Phala offchain rollup for the Graph Api Oracle 
- the Ink! smart contract to interact with the offchain rollup
- a UI to test and play with these smart contracts.
- A SubQuery project that indexes the data from dApp Staking on Astar Network
- the documentation to use these contracts

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
